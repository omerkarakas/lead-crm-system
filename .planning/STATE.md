[Issues that affect future work]

- None currently blocking
- Previous concern resolved: Auth redirect issue fixed with server-side token validation
- Notes stored in lead record - may need separate notes collection for Phase 6 (activity timeline)
- No file upload capability yet (needed for lead attachments in future phases)
- Tag autocomplete queries all leads - may need optimization for large datasets
- Welcome message stored in localStorage - consider moving to PocketBase config collection
